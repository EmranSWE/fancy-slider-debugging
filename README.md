On the Fancy Slider Debugging website I have fixed some error. 

## Technology Stack

## Feature of Fancy Slider Debugging
I get this website with some bug, Then I fixed bug. 

Whai I fixed:
* Create your own api key
* Find the error in line number 34 ,Found (data.hitS),but actually it is (data.hits)
*  check slider image length and minimum slider image need 2.
*  Previously it takes negative value , I fixed that it takes only positive value; Mind it: Time is millisecond,1000 =1 second

What User can Do:
